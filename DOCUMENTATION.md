## Missing Values
The problem of missing value is quite common in many real-life datasets. Missing value can bias the results of the machine learning models and/or reduce the accuracy of the model. 
Missing data is defined as the values or data that is not stored (or not present) for some variable/s in the given dataset. In Pandas, usually, missing values are represented by NaN. It stands for Not a Number.

### Checking for missing values
The following code finds total number of missing values in the dataframe, 'df'.
`df.isnull().sum().sum()`
